## Question 1

### Consider the following code segment. Enter what this code segment would output when the program is executed. Please do not forget to add new lines for certain print statements

- `System.out.println("cats");`
- `System.out.print("dogs");`
- `System.out.print("lions");`
- `System.out.print("bears");`
- `System.out.println("wolves");`
- `System.out.print("tigers");`

**Correct Answer**: 

- cats
- dogslionsbearswolves
- tigers

**Explanation**:
- The first print statement will output cat and then create a new line 
- The second print statement will start at the second new line because of the first print statement of `System.out.println("cats")` then dog will be printed out in the second line.
- Because the third and fourth print statements is not `println`, we stay at the second line and add lions and bears to the dog string without any spaces so it will look like `dogslionsbears`
- Then, we get to the 5th print statement which has a `println`. We will print wolves to the same second line as `dogslionsbears` so the new string will become `dogslionsbearswolves` then Java will create a new line right after
- Although the last print statement is NOT a new line print statement of `println`, because the previous line of code was a `println`, we will start in a new line and print out `tigers` in its own new line at the end 

## Question 2

### What is printed when the following code segment is executed? Please enter your answer below and account for all new lines.

- `System.out.println("Tesla is an electric car");`
- `System.out.println();`
- `System.out.println();`
- `System.out.println("Rivian is an electric truck");`
- `System.out.println();`
- `System.out.println("Nio is another electric car company");`
- `System.out.println("no more electric cars please");`
- `System.out.print("bye");`

**Correct Answer**: 

- Tesla is an electric car
- 
- 
- Rivian is an electric truck
- 
- Nio is another electric car company
- no more electric cars please
- bye

**Explanation**:
- For this question, just know the bullet points with no text means `System.out.println()` created a new line without any text so it is supposed to represent a new line with no text.

## Question 3

### Consider the following code segment. Enter what this code segment would output when the program is executed. Please do not forget to add new lines for certain print statements

- `double salesTax = 0.05;`
- `double price = 550.75;`
- `double priceWithTax = price + (salesTax * price);`
- `System.out.println("=======================================");`
- `System.out.println("Calculating your total cost.........");`
- `System.out.println("=======================================");`
- `System.out.println();`
- `System.out.println();`
- `System.out.println("The total tax is " + "$" + (salesTax * price) + " dollars");`
- `System.out.println("The total sale is " + "$" + priceWithTax);`

**Correct Answer**: 

- `=======================================`
- `Calculating your total cost.........`
- `=======================================`

- `The total tax is $27.5375 dollars`
- `The total sale is $578.2875`

**Explanation**:

- Let's break down the code segment step by step:

- `double salesTax = 0.05;`: This line defines a variable `salesTax` and initializes it with a value of 0.05, which represents 5% sales tax.

- `double price = 550.75;`: This line defines a variable `price` and initializes it with a value of 550.75, which represents the initial price before applying the sales tax.

- `double priceWithTax = price + (salesTax * price);`: This line calculates the total price including the sales tax by adding the original price to the product of the sales tax rate and the original price.

- `System.out.println("=======================================");`: This line prints a line of equal signs as a separator to the console.

- `System.out.println("Calculating your total cost.........");`: This line prints the message "Calculating your total cost........." to the console.

- `System.out.println("=======================================");`: This line prints another line of equal signs as a separator to the console.

- `System.out.println();`: This line prints a blank line, leaving an empty line in the console output.

- `System.out.println();`: This line prints another blank line, adding an additional empty line to the console output.

- `System.out.println("The total tax is " + "$" + (salesTax * price) + " dollars");`: This line prints the total tax amount by concatenating the strings "The total tax is ", "$" (as a currency symbol), the calculated tax amount, and " dollars".

- `System.out.println("The total sale is " + "$" + priceWithTax);`: This line prints the total sale amount, including the sales tax, by concatenating the strings "The total sale is ", "$" (as a currency symbol), and the calculated total price with tax.

Now, let's calculate the values:

- The total tax amount is `0.05 * 550.75` which is `27.5375`. 
- The total sale amount, including the sales tax, is `priceWithTax`, which is `550.75 + 27.5375` equals `578.2875`.
- With the calculated values, it will print out everything described in the correct answer section above 

## Question 4

### For this problem, create a three variables of any data type of your choice. After you create the three variables, print each variable in a new line new. After, re-assign each variable with a new value and re-print out your re-assigned values of each variable.

**Correct Answer**: 
- As long as you create three variables correctly and re-assign them correctly , any answer should be correct.

**Explanation with example answer**:
- `int number = 42;`
- `String greeting = "Hello, world!";`
- `double piValue = 3.14;`

- Print initial values
- `System.out.println("Initial values:");`
- `System.out.println(number);`
- `System.out.println(greeting);`
- `System.out.println(piValue);`

- Reassign new values to each variable
- `number = 100;`
- `greeting = "ChatGPT is amazing!";`
- `piValue = 2.718;`

- Print re-assigned values
- `System.out.println("Re-assigned values: ");`
- `System.out.println(number);`
- `System.out.println(greeting);`
- `System.out.println(piValue);`


## Question 5

### What would the following code output ?

- `int rating = 10;`
- `String name = "New Jeans"`;
- `boolean isKpopGroup = true;`
- `String sentence = name + " is a new K-pop group " + " " + "and they are rated as a " + rating + " rating! " + " This is absolutely " + isKpopGroup + "!!!!!!";`
- `System.out.println(sentence);`

**Correct Answer**: 
- `“New Jeans is a new K-pop group  and they are rated as a 10 rating!  This is absolutely true!!!!!!”`

**Explanation**:

Let's break down the code step by step:

- `int rating = 10;`: This line declares and initializes an integer variable named `rating` with the value 10.

- `String name = "New Jeans";`: This line declares and initializes a String variable named `name` with the value "New Jeans".

- `boolean isKpopGroup = true;`: This line declares and initializes a boolean variable named `isKpopGroup` with the value `true`.

- `String sentence = ...`: This line creates a String variable named `sentence` and initializes it with a concatenation of various variables and strings.

- Let's see how the concatenation happens:

- `String sentence = name + " is a new K-pop group " + " " + "and they are rated as a " + rating + " rating! " + " This is absolutely " + isKpopGroup + "!!!!!!";`

The concatenation follows from left to right:

- `name`: "New Jeans"
- `" is a new K-pop group "`: A string literal.
-  `" "`: A space string literal.
- `"and they are rated as a "`: A string literal.
-  `rating`: 10 (integer variable).
-  `" rating! "`: A string literal.
-  `" This is absolutely "`: A string literal.
-  `isKpopGroup`: true (boolean variable).
-  `"!!!!!!"`: A string literal.

- Now let's combine these parts:

- `"New Jeans is a new K-pop group  and they are rated as a 10 rating!  This is absolutely true!!!!!!"`

- Finally, the line `System.out.println(sentence);` prints the value of the `sentence` variable to the console. So, the **output** of the code would be: `New Jeans is a new K-pop group  and they are rated as a 10 rating!  This is absolutely true!!!!!!`


## Question 6

### What will this code segment print out when executed?


- `double testScore = 88.25;`
- `String testScoreStr = "" + (testScore + 0.25);`
- `System.out.println(testScoreStr);`

**Answer Choices**

- A) 88.5
- B) 88.75
- C) 89.25
- D) 89.5
- E) This is a compilation/syntax error

**Correct Answer: A) 88.5**

**Explanation:**

- Let's break down the code segment step by step to see what it does:

- `double testScore = 88.25;`
- Here, a variable `testScore` is declared and assigned the value 88.25, which is a double data type.

- `String testScoreStr = "" + (testScore + 0.25);`
- In this line, we have a concatenation operation. The expression `"" + (testScore + 0.25)` is evaluated first. Since the `+` operator is used with a string (`""`) and a numeric expression `(testScore + 0.25)`, Java will perform string concatenation.

- The numeric expression `testScore + 0.25` adds 88.25 and 0.25, resulting in 88.5. However, since we are using string concatenation with an empty string `""`, Java will convert the result to a string. Therefore, `testScoreStr` will be the string "88.5".

- `System.out.println(testScoreStr);`
- Finally, this line will print the value of `testScoreStr` to the console, which is "88.5". So, the correct answer is: A) 88.5


## Question 7:

**Which lines of code would result in a syntax error? (Lines 1 to Line 5)**

- Line 1: `public static void main(String args[])`
- Line 2: `System.out.println("my name is Gasper!")`
- Line 3: `int weight = 10.25;`
- Line 4: `system.out.print("Gasper's weight is " + weight + " pounds!");`
- Line 5: `System.out.Println("Gasper's sister is Genie!")}`

**Answer Choices**

- A) Line 1
- B) Line 1 and Line 2 and Line 5
- C) Line 2 and Line 3
- D) Line 1 and Line 2 and Line 3 and Line 4
- E) All of the above

**Correct Answer: E) All of the above**

**Explanation:**

- Line 1: `public static void main(String args[])`
  This line will result in a syntax error because it is missing a closing parenthesis in the method declaration. It should be: `public static void main(String args[]) {`.

- Line 2: `System.out.println("my name is Gasper!")`
  This line is a syntax error. It is missing a semicolon at the end of the print statement.

- Line 3: `int weight = 10.25;`
  This line will result in a syntax error. In Java, you cannot assign a double value directly to an integer variable without explicitly casting it to an int. It should be written as: `double weight = 10.25;` or `int weight = (int) 10.25;` if you want to truncate the decimal part.

- Line 4: `system.out.print("Gasper's weight is " + weight + " pounds!");`
  This line will result in a syntax error. Java is case-sensitive, and "system" is not recognized as the correct keyword "System" for the standard output stream. It should be `System.out.print("Gasper's weight is " + weight + " pounds!");` instead.

- Line 5: `System.out.Println("Gasper's sister is Genie!");`
  This line will result in a syntax error. The correct method name to print to the console is `println`, not `Println`. It should be `System.out.println("Gasper's sister is Genie!");` instead.

Now, let's analyze the options:

- A) Line 1: This answer choice is correct. Line 1 has a syntax error because it is missing a closing parenthesis in the method declaration. However, this is not the only syntax error, so this answer choice is incorrect.

- B) Line 1 and Line 2 and Line 5: Although Line 1 and Line 2 and Line 5 have syntax errors, this answer choice is incorrect. This is not the only syntax error, so it is not the best answer.

- C) Line 2 and Line 3: Although Line 2 and Line 3 have syntax errors, this answer choice is incorrect. This is not the only syntax error, so it is not the best answer.

- D) Line 1 and Line 2 and Line 3 and Line 4: Although Line 1 and Line 2 and Line 3 and Line 4 have syntax errors, this answer choice is incorrect. This is not the only syntax error, so it is not the best answer.

- E) All of the above: This answer choice is correct as all lines of the code snippet have syntax errors.

**The correct answer is E) All of the above.** All lines (Line 1 to Line 5) will cause a syntax error in the given code snippet.


## Question 8:

**Which of the following lines of code will result in a syntax error?**

- Line 1: `System.out.println("Google");`
- Line 2: `system.out.println("Apple");`
- Line 3: `System.out.print("Meta);`
- Line 4: `System.out.println("Amazon");`
- Line 5: `System.out.println("Netflix”);`

**Answer Choices**
- A) Line 2
- B) Line 2 and Line 5
- C) Line 2 and Line 3
- D) Line 2 and Line 3 and Line 4
- E) All of the above

**Correct Answer: C) Line 2 and Line 3**

**Explanation:**

- Line 1: `System.out.println("Google");`
  This line is correct. It will print "Google" to the console. No syntax error here.

- Line 2: `system.out.println("Apple");`
  This line has an error. In Java, the method names are case-sensitive, so it should be `System.out.println` with an uppercase "S." This will result in a syntax error.

- Line 3: `System.out.print("Meta);`
  This line also has an error. The closing double-quote is missing, which will cause a syntax error.

- Line 4: `System.out.println("Amazon");`
  This line is correct. It will print "Amazon" to the console. No syntax error here.

- Line 5: `System.out.println("Netflix”);`
  This line is correct. It will print "Netflix" to the console. No syntax error here.

Now let's analyze the options:

- A) Line 2: This is correct. As discussed above, Line 2 will result in a syntax error, but it is not the only syntax error in the code snippet, so this answer choice is incorrect.

- B) Line 2 and Line 5: This is incorrect. Line 5 will NOT result in a syntax error.

- D) Line 2 and Line 3 and Line 4: This is not correct. Line 4 does not have any syntax error, so this option is not accurate.

- E) All of the above: This is not correct. As discussed above, only Line 2 and Line 3 will result in a syntax error in the given code snippet.

**The correct answer is C) Line 2 and Line 3.** Both of these lines will cause a syntax error in the given code snippet.


## Question 9:

**Which of the following variable names in Java would NOT cause a compilation error (Syntax error)?**

- A) for
- B) 3rdPerson
- C) TOP STUDENT
- D) bark_meow_$bark
- E) meow?&2

**Correct Answer: D) bark_meow_$bark**

**Explanation:**

- A) for - This will cause a compilation error because "for" is a reserved keyword in Java used for loop constructs.

- B) 3rdPerson - This will cause a compilation error because variable names cannot start with a digit. They can start with an underscore, a letter, or a dollar sign.

- C) TOP STUDENT - This will cause a compilation error because variable names cannot contain spaces in Java. Instead, you can use underscores to separate words, like "TOP_STUDENT".

- D) bark_meow_$bark - This is a valid variable name. It follows the rules for valid Java variable names, as it starts with a letter and can include underscores and other characters.

- E) meow?&2 - This will cause a compilation error because variable names cannot contain special characters like "?", "&", or any other symbol except underscores.

Now, let's recap the correct answer:

- A) for - Compilation error (reserved keyword)
- B) 3rdPerson - Compilation error (cannot start with a digit)
- C) TOP STUDENT - Compilation error (invalid variable name due to spaces)
- D) bark_meow_$bark - No compilation error (valid variable name)
- E) meow?&2 - Compilation error (invalid variable name due to special characters)

**The correct answer is:**

**D) bark_meow_$bark**


## Question 10:

**Which of the following data types are primitive data types?**

- Choice 1: boolean
- Choice 2: char
- Choice 3: String
- Choice 4: double
- Choice 5: float
- Choice 6: Array

**A) Choice 1, Choice 2, Choice 4, Choice 5**

**Correct Answer Explanation:**

To determine the correct answer for this multiple-choice question, let's first define what a primitive data type is. In programming, a primitive data type is a basic data type provided by the programming language as a building block. These data types are not composed of other data types and have a fixed size.

Let's reevaluate the choices to identify which ones represent primitive data types.

- Choice 1: **boolean** - Primitive data type (it represents a single bit of information, typically denoted as true or false).

- Choice 2: **char** - Primitive data type (it represents a single character).

- Choice 3: **String** - Not a primitive data type. In most programming languages, String is a class or an object representing a sequence of characters, and it is not a fundamental data type.

- Choice 4: **double** - Primitive data type (it represents double-precision floating-point numbers).

- Choice 5: **float** - Primitive data type (it represents single-precision floating-point numbers).

- Choice 6: **Array** - Not a primitive data type. An array is a data structure that can hold multiple elements of the same type. It is a composite data type and not a fundamental data type.

Now, let's identify the answer choice that includes only primitive data types:

**A) Choice 1, Choice 2, Choice 4, Choice 5** - This option is correct. It includes all the primitive data types: boolean, char, double, and float.

**B) Choice 3 and Choice 6** - This option is incorrect because it includes Choice 3 (String) and Choice 6 (Array), which are not primitive data types.

**C) Choice 1 and Choice 2 and Choice 3 and Choice 4 and Choice 5** - This option is incorrect because it includes Choice 3 (String), which is not a primitive data type.

**D) Choice 1 and Choice 2 and Choice 3 and Choice 4 and Choice 6** - This option is incorrect because it includes Choice 3 (String) and Choice 6 (Array), neither of which are primitive data types.

**E) All of the above** - This option is incorrect because it includes Choice 3 (String) and Choice 6 (Array), which are not primitive data types.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A) Choice 1, Choice 2, Choice 4, Choice 5**
