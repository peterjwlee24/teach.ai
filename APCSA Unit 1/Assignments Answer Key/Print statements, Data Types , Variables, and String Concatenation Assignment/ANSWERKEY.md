# README.md - Data Types Quiz Answer and Explanation

## Question 9:

**Which of the following variable names in Java would NOT cause a compilation error (Syntax error)?**

- A) for
- B) 3rdPerson
- C) TOP STUDENT
- D) bark_meow_$bark
- E) meow?&2

**Correct Answer: D) bark_meow_$bark**

**Explanation:**

- A) for - This will cause a compilation error because "for" is a reserved keyword in Java used for loop constructs.

- B) 3rdPerson - This will cause a compilation error because variable names cannot start with a digit. They can start with an underscore, a letter, or a dollar sign.

- C) TOP STUDENT - This will cause a compilation error because variable names cannot contain spaces in Java. Instead, you can use underscores to separate words, like "TOP_STUDENT".

- D) bark_meow_$bark - This is a valid variable name. It follows the rules for valid Java variable names, as it starts with a letter and can include underscores and other characters.

- E) meow?&2 - This will cause a compilation error because variable names cannot contain special characters like "?", "&", or any other symbol except underscores.

Now, let's recap the correct answer:

- A) for - Compilation error (reserved keyword)
- B) 3rdPerson - Compilation error (cannot start with a digit)
- C) TOP STUDENT - Compilation error (invalid variable name due to spaces)
- D) bark_meow_$bark - No compilation error (valid variable name)
- E) meow?&2 - Compilation error (invalid variable name due to special characters)

**The correct answer is:**

**D) bark_meow_$bark**


## Question 10:

**Which of the following data types are primitive data types?**

- Choice 1: boolean
- Choice 2: char
- Choice 3: String
- Choice 4: double
- Choice 5: float
- Choice 6: Array

**A) Choice 1, Choice 2, Choice 4, Choice 5**

**Correct Answer Explanation:**

To determine the correct answer for this multiple-choice question, let's first define what a primitive data type is. In programming, a primitive data type is a basic data type provided by the programming language as a building block. These data types are not composed of other data types and have a fixed size.

Let's reevaluate the choices to identify which ones represent primitive data types.

- Choice 1: **boolean** - Primitive data type (it represents a single bit of information, typically denoted as true or false).

- Choice 2: **char** - Primitive data type (it represents a single character).

- Choice 3: **String** - Not a primitive data type. In most programming languages, String is a class or an object representing a sequence of characters, and it is not a fundamental data type.

- Choice 4: **double** - Primitive data type (it represents double-precision floating-point numbers).

- Choice 5: **float** - Primitive data type (it represents single-precision floating-point numbers).

- Choice 6: **Array** - Not a primitive data type. An array is a data structure that can hold multiple elements of the same type. It is a composite data type and not a fundamental data type.

Now, let's identify the answer choice that includes only primitive data types:

**A) Choice 1, Choice 2, Choice 4, Choice 5** - This option is correct. It includes all the primitive data types: boolean, char, double, and float.

**B) Choice 3 and Choice 6** - This option is incorrect because it includes Choice 3 (String) and Choice 6 (Array), which are not primitive data types.

**C) Choice 1 and Choice 2 and Choice 3 and Choice 4 and Choice 5** - This option is incorrect because it includes Choice 3 (String), which is not a primitive data type.

**D) Choice 1 and Choice 2 and Choice 3 and Choice 4 and Choice 6** - This option is incorrect because it includes Choice 3 (String) and Choice 6 (Array), neither of which are primitive data types.

**E) All of the above** - This option is incorrect because it includes Choice 3 (String) and Choice 6 (Array), which are not primitive data types.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A) Choice 1, Choice 2, Choice 4, Choice 5**
